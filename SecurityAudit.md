# Security Audit Report

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Poll Deletion and Editing Without Ownership Verification

- **Impact:** Any authenticated user could delete or edit polls they do not own, leading to unauthorized data loss or manipulation.
- **Fix:** Ownership checks were added to ensure only the poll creator can delete or update their polls.

### 2. Voting Logic Not Enforcing Poll Settings

- **Impact:** Users could vote multiple times on polls that should restrict to one vote per user, or vote anonymously on polls requiring authentication, enabling vote manipulation and breaking poll integrity.
- **Fix:** Voting logic now enforces `requireAuthentication` and `allowMultipleVotes` settings. Users must be authenticated if required, and cannot vote more than once if multiple votes are disallowed.

### 3. Unsanitized Poll Creation Input

- **Impact:** Poll questions and options could contain malicious or malformed data, potentially leading to injection attacks or broken UI.
- **Fix:** Poll creation now sanitizes input, requiring questions to be at least 5 characters and options to be non-empty and trimmed.

### 4. Business Logic Not Consistently Enforced Server-Side

- **Impact:** Business rules could be bypassed from the client, leading to inconsistent application state and potential abuse.
- **Fix:** All critical business logic checks are now performed server-side in Server Actions.

## Summary of Fixes Implemented

- Ownership checks for poll deletion and editing
- Enforcement of poll settings in voting logic
- Input sanitization for poll creation and editing
- Consistent server-side enforcement of business rules

All fixes were implemented to maintain legitimate user functionality and improve overall security and reliability of the application.
